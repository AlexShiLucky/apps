config SYSTEM_CUTERM
	bool "CU serial terminal"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable the CU serial terminal.  This is a minimalistic
		implementation of the 'cu' terminal program (part of Taylor UUCP for
		ages). Using it, you can simply open a serial port and interact with
		it. Using '~.' you can leave the terminal program and drop back to nsh.

		This terminal might come in handy for other people that have e.g. GS
		modems, GPS receivers or other devices with text based serial
		communications attached to their Nuttx systems.
